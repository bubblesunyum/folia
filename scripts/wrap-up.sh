# Lane default is the full gate (default verify.sh lane); --quick while
# iterating, --full for the browser suite. Everything ledger-shaped happens
# first (closes, notes, memories), because every one of them invalidates the
# export. The push goes next: it runs `bd dolt commit` and its own export
# regen, so it is also a ledger write and must precede the final export.
# After the export only reads run (verify), then the commit carries the
# fresh export with it.
#
# Failures: a failed push warns and continues (best-effort — the local ledger
# plus the committed export preserve everything but machine-loss redundancy,
# and --check keeps nagging). A failed gate aborts before any commit, so fix,
# reopen if needed, and rerun. Rerunning on a settled tree is a no-op success.
